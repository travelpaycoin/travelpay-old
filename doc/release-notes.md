Recommended Update
==============

üó∫Ô∏èTpc Core üëõ 3.0.2 CE ¬©Ô∏è - üëí RELEASE üëí is a recommended, semi-mandatory update for all users. This release contains transaction creation bug fixes for xTPC spends, automint calculation adjustments, and other various updates/fixes.

xTPC spending requires this update.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Tpc-Qt (on Mac) or tpcd/tpc-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

üó∫Ô∏èTpc Core üëõ is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

üó∫Ô∏èTpc Core üëõ should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**


Notable Changes

Functions renamed
-----------------
Stashedsend is now Swift-X

New algorithm
-------------
We dropped MIDAS and will use DGW. More info will follow.

Automint
--------
Autominiting with zerocoin. More info will follow.

New look and design
-------------------
We have new look and desing, currently it is a dirty version. It includes new GUI layout, new colors.

Performance
-----------
Current source base is much faster and cleaner than tpc's previous one. It uses all cpu's and there are 
no performance issues which we could observe, it is just much faster then previous source base.

BIP38
-----
We have BIP38 including a tool with password encryption and decrpytion features

Blockexplorer
-------------
We finaly have built in blockexplorer which works on all tpc's networks.

User friendly
-------------
There are some new features which improve usability as well as user experience in general. More info to follow.

Auto Wallet Backup
---------------------
In addition to the automatic wallet backup that is done at each start of the client, a new automatic backup function has been added that will, by default, create a backup of the wallet file during each xTPC mint operation (xTPC spends which re-mint their change are also included in this). This functionality is controlled by the `-backupxion` command-line option, which defaults to `1` (enabled, auto-backup).

Users that wish to prevent this behavior (not recommended) can pass `-backupxion=0` at the command-line when starting the client, or add `backupxion=0` to their `Travelpaycoin.conf` file.

xTPC Automint Calculations
---------------------
A bug in the automint calculations was made apparent on mainnet when block times exceeded expectations, resulting in xTPC mint transactions that were in an unconfirmed state to still be treated as if they had never been minted. This caused automint to effectively mint more than what was intended.

xTPC Spending Fix
---------------------
The size of xTPC spend transactions is knowingly larger than normal transactions, and while this was expected, a much stricter check against the scriptsig size is used for mainnet, causing the transactions to be rejected by the mempool, and thus not being packaged into any blocks.

xTPC Transaction Recovery
---------------------
Due to the aforementioned issue with xTPC spending, users may find that their attempted spends are now conflicted and xTPC balances are not represented as expected. "Recovery" of these transactions can be done using the following methods:

1. GUI:

   The Privacy tab has the `Reset` and `Rescan` buttons that can be used to restore these mints/spends from a state of being marked as unavailable.

2. RPC:

   The RPC commands `resetspentzerocoin` and `resetmintzerocoin` are the command-line counterparts to the above, and can be used by users that do not use the GUI wallet.

RPC Changes
---------------------
The `bip38decrypt` command has had it's parameter order changed to be more consistent with it's counterpart. The command now expects the Tpc address as it's first parameter and the passphrase as it's second parameter.

Bip38 Compatibility With 3rd Party Tools
---------------------
The in-wallet bip38 encryption method was leaving the final 4 bytes of the encrypted key blank. This caused an incompatibility issue with 3rd party tools like the paper wallet generators that could decrypt bip38 encrypted keys. Cross-tool compatibility has now been restored.

3.0.2 Change log
=================

This release is a fork to the old chain. Detailed release notes follow.
We dropped MIDAS and use DGW as well as some other changes. Previous old version
was based on old projects which were not updated. One of our main goals for v3 release
was to get closer to bitcoin's source and update in general sources to some newer
and cleaner codebase then it was previously. We forked from PIVX which is better
maintenanced then previous releases of üó∫Ô∏èTpc Core üëõ which are based on obsolete code.
In this version everything is new, one big feature iz xTPC which iz zerocoin for
tpc. Port and other settings remain same. Please foolow our wiki for more information
about how to backup your wallet/keys and upgrade to new wallet as well as recovery paths
and detailed explanations of how to use new code. One big difference is finally restricting
in better was single mode masternode, as multi mode is not usefull within larger networks.

Additional files and features
=============================

bootstrap.dat
-----------------
Copy `bootstrap.dat` to your data dir and launch your client. After it finishes, `bootstrap.dat` will be automaticly renamed to `bootstrap.dat.old`

bootstrap.dat info

Setting up the Gitian image
======================

Credentials
--------------
user: `gitianuser`
pass: `cevap`

user: `root`
pass: `cevap`

On your machine edit or create `~/.ssh/config` and add:

```
Host gitian
    HostName localhost
    Port 22222
    User gitianuser
```

Open a new terminal tab and enter (_check your .ssh folder for file name, id_rsa.pub and id_ecdsa.pub are defaults_):

```
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub gitian:.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now connect to your gitian with: `ssh gitian`, no password will be required for ssh connection.

Now build base vm:

```
cd gitian-builder
bin/make-base-vm --lxc --arch amd64 --suite trusty
```
There will be a lot of warnings printed during the build of the image. These can be ignored.

**Note**: When sudo asks for a password, enter the password for the user gitianuser not for root.

Getting and building the inputs
--------------------------------------
At this point you have two options, you can either use the automated script (found in https://github.com/cevap/tpc/blob/master/contrib/gitian-build.sh, only works in Debian/Ubuntu) or you could manually do everything by following this guide. If you are using the automated script, then run it with the --setup command. Afterwards, run it with the --build command (example: contrib/gitian-build.sh -b signer 3.0.2). Otherwise ignore this.

Follow the instructions in https://github.com/cevap/tpc/blob/master/doc/release-process.md in the bitcoin repository under 'Fetch and create inputs' to install sources which require manual intervention. Also optionally follow the next step: 'Seed the Gitian sources cache and offline git repositories' which will fetch the remaining files required for building offline.

_**Note**: please use our links here, I left cevap as I do not want to remove it later_

That's it, follow release notes and how to build on our repo

Build with gitian
============

Signer is key, please use your github public key _(or [create new gpg key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/) for gitian only and [add it to your account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/), the same goes for SSH key ([create](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) | [add](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)_). To show your key, run in terminal: `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG`

The output will show you key/keys, like this:
```
tor@tor ~ $ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
/home/tor/.gnupg/secring.gpg
----------------------------
sec   3072R/49464B32BA6683BA 2017-03-13
uid                          developer (dev@i2pmail.org) <dev@i2pmail.org>
ssb   3072R/78E10152BEC6C3C6 2017-03-13
```


Take the key from sec line,

  sec   3072R/**49464B32BA6683BA** 2017-03-13

which would be in this case `49464B32BA6683BA`. This is your SIGNER.

GPG does not have enough entropy
----------------------------------------------
If you use high encryption and set your key to 4096bits, you might get some message similar to this `GPG does not have enough entropy`.

One of workarounds would be package for generating entropy called haveged. Install `haveged` and `rng-tools` by running:
`sudo apt-get install -y haveged rng-tools`

then create entropy with:
```
# run it with sudo if it requires root access
cat /dev/random | rngtest -c 1000
``` 

Now you can create your key with `gpg --gen-key`

Gist gitian build scripts
----------------------------
**Note**: Please change SIGNER to your key and version to desired version, in current release it is version 3.0.2, in future releases gist will be updated.

If you use scripts, after wget has downloaded the script, run `sed -i 's/49464B32BA6683BA/YOURGPGKEY/g''  and replace `YOURGPGKEY` with your LONG Key ID. The same can be done with version.
