Tpcian OS Installation Manual
=============================

Tpcian is a collection of different Ubuntu 16.04 based media with tpc-coin travelpaycoin software ready installed and updated automatially from the master tpc-coin ppa.  It is broken down into 3 different sets of images.

1) Tpcian ISO -- this is an install-to computer iso image that will install Ubuntu Tpcian 16.04 to a local computer.  Available in both i386 and amd64 versions  

2) Tpcian USB -- this is meant as a complete copy-and-run solution.  With this image you can run directly from the usb medium, also available in i386 and amd64 versions  

3) Tpcian VDI -- These images are meant for use in Oracle VIrtualBox environments.  Again, i386 and mad64 versions are available 


Virtualbox VDI installation
---------------------------
amd64 and i386 follow the same installation process.  
1) Download the current Tpcian vdi (32 or 64 bit) from http://download/travelpaycoin.org/Tpcian/vdi  
2) Unzip the vdi file that you have just downloaded  
3) Create a new 32 or 64 bit Virtual Machine in Oracle Virtualbox as documented at <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual" target="_blank">https://www.virtualbox.org/manual</a>

D) remove the USB Flash Drive replace in your chosen system and reboot (note: first boot will take a short time to configure the tpcian user home directory, please be patient).  
 

2) Linux/OSX Install

&nbsp;i) install mkusb for your system using the appropriate package manager.

&nbsp;ii) insert your USB Flash Drive (16 GB or Larger, USB3.0 Recommended)) into an
  unused USB slot.

&nbsp;i) insert your USB Flash Drive (16 GB or Larger, USB3.0 Recommended)) into an
  unused USB slot.  
&nbsp;ii) Enter the following command at the CLI prompt in the directory you downloaded the USB image into 
 
"sudo xzcat Tpcian-<amd64|i386\>-<version\>.img.xz  | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 status=progress"

&nbsp;iii) once dd has finished you can remove the USB Flash Drive replace in your chosen system and reboot (note: first boot will take a short time to configure the tpcian user home directory, please be patient).  

Tpcian ISO Installation
---------------------- 

Download the current ISO image (i386 or amd64) from http://download.travelpaycoin.org/iso/ and burn the image to a DVD using the appropriate tools (far too many burning tools to mention here)    

Put the DVD that you have created into the DVD drive of the system and select try or install.  
-- note: if "Try Tpcian without installing" is selected, ALL changes you make to the system will be lost on reboot.  This is due to the installation being on DVD with no write capabilities.  If needed, you can create a casper-rw usb flash drive to save your changes - this is beyond the scope of this document.
